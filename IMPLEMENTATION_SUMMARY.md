- Features: drag-and-drop scheduling, conflict detection, cost calculation

### ‚úÖ FASE 9: QR Check-in/Check-out System
- `QRCodeGenerator` with download/copy/regenerate functions
- `QRScanner` with camera integration and ZXing library
- `/check-in` page with multiple tabs and real-time stats
- `/bookings/[id]` detailed view with integrated QR codes
- Access history tracking and activity logs

### ‚úÖ FASE 10: Testing and Optimization
- Build verification: ‚úÖ Successful
- Type checking: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some Next.js 15 async params issues (non-blocking)
- Linting: ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor unused variables and type issues (non-blocking)
- Performance: Optimized with dynamic imports and proper loading states
