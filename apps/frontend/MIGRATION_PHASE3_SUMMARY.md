## 📝 Usage Examples

### Server Actions (Direct Use)
```typescript
import { createSpaceAction, createBookingAction, checkAvailabilityAction } from '@/lib/actions'

// Create a new meeting room
const space = await createSpaceAction({
  name: 'Conference Room A',
  type: 'CONFERENCE_ROOM',
  capacity: 12,
  amenities: ['Projector', 'Whiteboard', 'Video Conference'],
  hourlyRate: 45.00
})

// Check availability
const availability = await checkAvailabilityAction({
  spaceId: space.data.id,
  startTime: new Date('2024-01-15T09:00:00Z'),
  endTime: new Date('2024-01-15T11:00:00Z')
})

// Create recurring booking
const booking = await createBookingAction({
  spaceId: space.data.id,
  title: 'Weekly Team Meeting',
  startTime: new Date('2024-01-15T09:00:00Z'),
  endTime: new Date('2024-01-15T10:00:00Z'),
  recurrence: {
    type: 'WEEKLY',
    daysOfWeek: [1, 3, 5], // Monday, Wednesday, Friday
    occurrences: 12
  }
})
```

### API Endpoints (Backward Compatibility)
```typescript
// Create space via API
const response = await fetch('/api/spaces', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Phone Booth 1',
    type: 'PHONE_BOOTH',
    capacity: 1,
    hourlyRate: 15.00
  })
})

// Check availability
const availability = await fetch('/api/bookings/check-availability', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    spaceId: 'space-id',
    startTime: '2024-01-15T14:00:00Z',
    endTime: '2024-01-15T15:00:00Z'
  })
})

// Get booking statistics
const stats = await fetch('/api/bookings/stats?includeRevenue=true&includeUtilization=true')
```

### Availability Management
```typescript
// Set weekly availability
await createAvailabilityAction({
  spaceId: 'space-id',
  dayOfWeek: 1, // Monday
  startTime: '08:00',
  endTime: '18:00',
  isAvailable: true,
  recurrenceType: 'WEEKLY'
})

// Bulk update multiple spaces
await bulkUpdateAvailabilityAction({
  spaceIds: ['space1', 'space2', 'space3'],
  updates: [
    {
      dayOfWeek: 6, // Saturday
      startTime: '10:00',
      endTime: '16:00',
      isAvailable: false,
      reason: 'Weekend maintenance'
    }
  ]
})
```
